# Travel App

## Installation

First you'll need to install ionic CLI and Cordova 8.0.0. Before you do that, you'll need a recent version of Node.js. Download the installer for Node.js 6 or greater and then proceed to install the Ionic CLI and Cordova for native app development:

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic@latest  cordova@8.0.0
```

For checking if the installation is correct:
```bash
$ ionic -v #3.20.0 or greater
$ cordova -v #8.0.0
```

Then you have to install node packages:

```bash
$ npm install
```
